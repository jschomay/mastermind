        <p>Mastermind with a twist! I built this mastermind solver in order to learn me some Haskell and Elm.</p>
        <p>Pick a 4 color combination from the following colors: </p>
        <div class="info__colors">Blue | Green | Orange | Pink | Red | Yellow</div>
        <p>For example, you can choose (Blue, Green, Pink, Red) or (Blue, Blue, Yellow, Orange)</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the computer already chose a random guess for you to score!</p>
        <p>Score the computer's guess using the usual mastermind rules and it will generate another guess. As long as you accurately
          score the computer's guesses it should be able to successfully guess your combination within 7 rounds.
